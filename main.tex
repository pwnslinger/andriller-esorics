\section{Motivation}
\subsection{Challenges} % statefullness, input generation, introspection, vm management (sync and paging) - paralelize-able
Performing fuzzing on domains where a set of restrictions enforced by system architecture like modules interdependence to the environment, statefull protocols, and crash recovery latency demands a diligent robust design. Hence, in the following, we discuss the challenges in applying coverage-guided fuzzing on the android system services. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Statefullness: Performance of fuzzing is measured by the number of successful execution loops in a particular time frame. Applications cache the execution results of previous runs to reduce the response time or in case of protocols to track the steps taken. Keep tracking of states in fuzz testing of application that two execution of the same input might yield different results is of vital importance. In order to reduce the likelihood of

\subsection{ARTist}
We build our code instrumentation as modules for the ARTist tool \cite{artist}. We implement two modules for providing feedback from within the systemserver: One for feeding back coverage information to AFL and Troop, and another one for detecting crashes. Further, we patched ARTist such that it can replace the system compiler, which automatically applies our modules to the systemserver upon each fresh emulator start.

Coverage. To provide precise feedback, AFLFuzz’s coverage module injects tracking code at basic blocks granularity. At compiletime, deterministic basic block IDs are generated and embedded into the code so that the injected code can make use of them at runtime. The collected basic block IDs are stored to compute the edge coverage and written to AFL’s shared memory buffer to indicate the path of execution triggered by the current input. In order to reduce the amount of instrumented methods, and therefore improve the precision of our coverage metric and reduce the runtime overhead, we conduct a light-weight static reachability analysis as a pre-processing step. We leverage class-hierarchy information to infer the set of reachable methods per API. We filter invocations of methods that do not reside in Android packages, e.g., classes within the JDK. Further, we follow the approach by axplorer \cite{backes2016demystifying} to stop at IPC boundaries, i.e., we do not descent into public API methods that are fuzzed separately. Not instrumenting the entire systemserver also prevents false positives, e.g., when background tasks are executed by the system and new execution paths are triggered independently from the fuzzing input. The resulting set of reachable methods is subsequently used as a whitelist for the instrumentation, i.e., only reachable methods are modified to return coverage feedback. This implies that we have to start a fresh emulator, because each new API now comes with a pre-computed list of reachable methods that results in a different instrumentation.

Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.

Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.
